## Bubble Sort
### Best Case:
Already sorted ArrayList (in this case, least to greatest) ... because no swaps will be made during any of the n-1 passes, where n is the number of elements in the ArrayList.
### Worst Case:
Reverse-sorted ArrayList (in this case, greatest to least) ... because every comparison will result in a swap, since every element is greater than its right neighbor.

## Selection Sort
### Best Case:

### Worst Case:


## Insertion Sort
### Best Case:
Already sorted ArrayList (in this case, least to greatest) ... because every element that is added to the sorted portion from the unsorted portion is already greater than the previously sorted elements and thus doesn't have to be "walked" anywhere.
### Worst Case:
Reverse-sorted ArrayList (in this case, greatest to least) ... because every element has to be "walked" to the leftmost index when it's added to the sorted portion.
